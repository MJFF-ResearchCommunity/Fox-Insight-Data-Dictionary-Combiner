# Fox Insight Data Dictionary Combiner
Python script to consolidate Data Dictionaries for the Fox Insight dataset. Combining the data into a single spreadsheet has made it easier for me to understand and work with the data. The script produces a single table. 

For use with the machine-readable version of the Fox Insight data dictionary, which may be found here: https://foxden.michaeljfox.org/insight/resources/Data_Dictionary_2024-04-27.zip
